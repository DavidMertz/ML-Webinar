    "## Avoiding Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for train/test splits of data is always, at heart, a desire to avoid overfitting.  It is straightforward in supervised learning problems to fit a model against all the available data.  Since we, by definition, do not yet have the data we do not have, we want a proxy for \"the novel data we might see in the future.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the best proxy we can come up with is simply a portion of the original data that did not participate in the fitting of the model.  We rely on an assumption that our sample data is similar to observations we will obtain in the future.  However, there is really nothing better we might choose as such a proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `train_test_split()` to divide the data between a training and testing set if a very reasonable approach.  By default, this utility function shuffles the data before splitting it; in general this will minimize effects related to order of collection or collation of the dataset.  However, especially on moderate sized datasets of hundreds or thousands of samples (but not really of tens of thousands, or millions), the particular accident of a randomized split can still lead to artifacts."

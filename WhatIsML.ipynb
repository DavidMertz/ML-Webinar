This idea of \"Hebbian networks\" has existed since the 1940s, but it really only became a machine learning technique with Paul Werbos' 1975 introduction of \"backpropagation\" as a means to train such networks. Either way, the ideas are fairly old.\n",

Layers generally each have many more neurons than the dozen or fewer shown in textbook illustrations like the one above.

If we train a model extremely accurately against the data itself, metrics we use for the quality of the model will probably show high values.  However, in this scenario, the model is unlikely to extend well to novel data, which is usually the entire point of developing a model and making predictions.  By training in a fine tuned way against one dataset, we might have done nothing more than memorize that collection of values; or at least memorize a spurious pattern that exists in that particular sample data collection.\n",

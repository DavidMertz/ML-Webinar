However, in this scenario, the model is unlikely to extend well to novel data, which is usually the entire point of developing a model and making predictions.  By training in a fine tuned way against one dataset, we might have done nothing more than memorize that collection of values; or at least memorize a spurious pattern that exists in that particular sample data collection.\n",

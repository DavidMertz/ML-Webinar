The difference between classification and regression is simply whether the target is categorical or continuous.

Using the familiar facilities in Pandas, we can improve the initial data before applying scikit-learn to it. In particular, I failed to validate the field \"`Years of post-secondary education (e.g. BA=4; Ph.D.=10)`\" as a required integer. Also, the \"`Timestamps`\" added by the form interface are gratuitous for these purposes—they are all within a couple minutes of each other, but the order or spacing is unlikely to have any value to our models.\n",

    "Let us use scikit-learn to model the respondents. In particular, we would like to know whether other features of attendees are a good predictor of how successful they found the tutorial. A very common pattern you will see in machine learning based on starting DataFrames is to drop one column for the X features, and keep that one for the y target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my analysis, I felt a binary measure of success was more relevant than a scalar measure initially collected as a 1-10 scale. Moreover, if the target is simplified this way, it becomes appropriate to use a *classification* algorithm as opposed to a *regression* algorithm. It would be a mistake to treat the 1-10 scale as a categorical consisting of 10 independent labels—there is something inherently ordinal about these labels, although scikit-learn will happily calculate models as if there is not. On the other hand, responses to this ordinal question is generally non-uniform in distribution, usually with a clustering of values near the top values.\n",

The idea here is that the capital stands for the independent variables, but in general one expects there to be multiple such feature variables. The target consists of just one dependent variable, and hence its lowercase. The feature set and the target will always have the same number of rows.\n",

While `RandomForestClassifier` is incredibly powerful, and very often produces the most accurate predictions among all classifiers, for this particular data a single `DecisionTreeClassifer` does better.
